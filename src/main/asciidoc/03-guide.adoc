This is a step by step guide on how to create a working Mapper for your connectors.

=== steps

1. Add the mapper library to your connector framework project.

2. Create a folder structure for your mappings. The structure can be connector specific but they *must* be named 'mappings'.
These folders will contain the robots created in the following step.

3. Make a robot for *each* sourceType and *each* targetType. The name of a mapping robot *must* be unique.
The 'MappingTemplate.xill'-robot is the template that each of these mapping robots must follow.

4. Run the 'Build.xill'. This will create the 'Mapper' robot in the '/config' folder of your project.
